# TDW
[The Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com) news reader app for Android. It uses
their new [API](http://thedailywtf.com/articles/tdwtf-api).

## Status
It is currently just a MVP. It can load articles in a endless list style and
show the content for a article. However, it does not load article images and
lacks code formatting.

I have been unsuccessful in getting my tests to work on activities and async
tasks.
